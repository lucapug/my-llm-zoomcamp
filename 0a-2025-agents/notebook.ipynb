[ctrl+f] is your friend, use it! It is a universal shortcut and works in all apps/browsers.\\nWhat does the error say? There will often be a description of the error or instructions on what is needed or even how to fix it. I have even seen a link to the solution. Does it reference a specific line of your code?\\nRestart app or server/pc.\\nGoogle it, use ChatGPT, Bing AI etc.\\nIt is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the fly issue and likely the solution.\\nSearch using: <technology> <problem statement>. Example: pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.\\nThere are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments.\\nCheck the tech\\u2019s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function.\\nTry uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action. Remember to restart the server/pc for reinstalls.\\nSometimes reinstalling fails to resolve the issue but works if you uninstall first.\\nPost your question to Stackoverflow. Read the Stackoverflow guide on posting good questions.\\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask\\nThis will be your real life.

Does it have a line number to the \\u201coffending\\u201d code and have you check it for typos?\\nWhat have you tried that did not work?

Describe what has changed in the environment.\\nProvide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.\\nTake a break and come back later. You will be amazed at how often you figure out the solution after letting your brain rest.
